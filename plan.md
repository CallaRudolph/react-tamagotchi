Planning process for React & Redux Independent Project:

As of 9/22/17, Tamagotchi app only displays and has functionality for food levels.

Plan is to mimic this functionality for sleep and play levels, as well as slow down the timer so that the game can be properly played.

Some additional styling and/or Bootstrap would tidy up the project to share on my portfolio.
